- **Secure Networks**: Only use trusted internet connections for wallet access

## Schema

Magic Portfolio automatically generates schema tags for your pages based on the `content.js` file.

## Open Graph image

Social sharing images (open-graph and twitter) are automatically generated with `next/og`.

  const description = home.description;

The above declaration generates the social image with the title of the page. You can use a static image by replacing the `ogImage` value with a path to an image in the `public` directory.
