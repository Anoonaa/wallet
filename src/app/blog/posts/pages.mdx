## Security Settings Overview

Your Bantu-Sphere wallet includes comprehensive security settings that help protect your digital assets. Understanding and properly configuring these settings is essential for maintaining the security of your funds.

<CodeBlock

    highlight="6"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const securitySettings = {
    'biometric':        true,
    'twoFactor':        true,
    'smsAlerts':        true,
    'emailAlerts':      true,
    'transactionPin':   false,
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "Wallet Security Configuration"
  }
]} />

The settings above show how to enable or disable various security features in your Bantu-Sphere wallet. Setting `transactionPin` to false means PIN verification is disabled for transactions.

## Enabling Additional Security Features

When adding new security measures to your wallet, they need to be configured in your security settings.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="6"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const securitySettings = {
    'biometric':        true,
    'twoFactor':        true,
    'smsAlerts':        true,
    'emailAlerts':      true,
    'transactionPin':   false,
    'deviceTrust':      true,
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "Enhanced Security Configuration"
  }
]} />

The configuration above adds device trust verification to your security settings. This ensures that only trusted devices can access your wallet, providing an additional layer of protection for your funds.
